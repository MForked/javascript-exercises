## There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

# Seven primitive data types:
* `number` for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).
* `bigint` for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
* `string` for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
* `boolean` for true/false.
* `null` for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
* `undefined` for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
* `symbol` for unique identifiers.

- And one non-primitive data type:
* `object` for more complex data structures.


## Variables

* JavaScript has three types of variables: var vs let vs const
* var vs let vs const
- var: Can declare multi variables in same name. And last one is overwrite it's value of above one.
- let: Can't declare variable by same name. It's show an error message in console.
- const: all convenience of `let` with, once a variable is assigned with `const`, it cannot be reassigned(value).

## Logical operators

* There are four logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT), ?? (Nullish Coalescing).
